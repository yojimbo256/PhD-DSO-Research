# PhD-DSO-Research

This repository hosts the code and documentation related to my PhD research on AI-driven DevSecOps, with a focus on automating compliance and security monitoring within DevOps workflows. The primary objective of this research is to integrate AI-driven tools into the software development pipeline, specifically for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring continuous compliance, risk management, and security.

## üìå Current Focus

The current stage of the research revolves around:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **CVE Scanner Development**  
- Develop an automated CVE scanner that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities.  
- Implementing the functionality for scanning vulnerabilities from the [NVD CVE database](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/).  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Compliance Automation**  
- Automating security and compliance assessments throughout the DevSecOps lifecycle.  
- Using AI/ML models for enhanced threat detection and prediction.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Pipeline Integration**  
- Working towards integrating the CVE scanner, vulnerability reports, and automated security checks into a fully functioning CI/CD pipeline.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Management Framework (RMF) Automation**  
- Integrating RMF steps into automated security and compliance checks.

## üöÄ Next Steps

The following next steps are critical to continue progressing with the research:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Expand CVE Scanner**  
- Continue improving the CVE scanner functionality to support additional threat sources.  
- Implement the full integration of the scanner into the CI/CD pipeline.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Develop AI/ML Models**  
- Begin training AI models for automated threat detection and prediction.  
- Use datasets from vulnerability databases and threat intelligence feeds.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Complete CI/CD Pipeline**  
- Design and build a functional CI/CD pipeline that supports:  
  - Continuous security checks.  
  - Compliance automation.  
  - Automated threat detection and remediation.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Integrate with RMF**  
- Build out automated processes to align DevSecOps practices with DoD RMF compliance standards.  

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Research Papers and Documentation**  
- Continue writing the literature review and methodology for the PhD dissertation.  
- Document each milestone and research finding in the `docs/` directory for future publication and review.
